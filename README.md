ABSTRACT </h2>

*"Ms. Pac-Man was released in North America in January 1982, and is one of the most popular arcade video games of all time. This popularity led to its adoption as an official title by Namco, the creator of Pac-Man, which was released in the United States in late 1980.*

*The gameplay of Ms. Pac-Man is very similar to that of the original Pac-Man. The player earns points by eating pellets and avoiding ghosts (contact with one causes Ms. Pac-Man to lose a life). Eating an energizer (or "power pellet") causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing them to be eaten for extra points. Bonus fruits can be eaten for increasing point values, twice per round. As the rounds increase, the speed increases, and energizers generally lessen the duration of the ghosts' vulnerability, eventually stopping altogether."*

There are also some differences from the original Pac-Man:

- The game has four different mazes that appear in different color schemes, and alternate after each of the game's intermissions are seen. The pink maze appears in levels 1 & 2, the light blue maze appears in levels 3, 4, & 5, the brown maze appears in levels 6 through 9, and the dark blue maze appears in levels 10 through 14. After level 14, the maze configurations alternate every 4th level.

- Three of the four mazes (the first, second, and fourth ones) have two sets of warp tunnels, as opposed to only one in the original maze.

- The walls have a solid color rather than an outline, which makes it easier for a novice player to see where the paths around the mazes are.

- The ghosts' behavioral patterns are different, and include semi-random movement, which prevents the use of patterns to clear each round. Blinky and Pinky move randomly in the first several seconds of each level, until the first reversal. Inky and Sue still use the same movement patterns from the previous game to their respective corners, again until the first reversal.

<h2>
Testing </h2>

The main objective of the project is to optimize the execution of the game Ms. Pac-Man. The project introduced reinforcement learning as a major innovation and objective. In order to determine which parameters are going to optimize the program, we will propose some changes that we believe will make a significant difference. The modifications can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Hallvardr/Hallvardr.github.io/blob/master/Pacman_mods" class="btn"> Pacman Mods</a>

From the original code: <a href="https://github.com/Hallvardr/Hallvardr.github.io/blob/master/Pacman_mods/pacman_Original.py" class="btn">pacman_Original.py</a> , we modified the parameters we thought would optimize the program. All the modifications can be found in the folder.

The runned Jupyter code can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Hallvardr/Hallvardr.github.io/blob/master/Jupyter/pacman.ipynb" class="btn">Jupyter Code</a>
